# AlgorithmOptimizationPractice
A review over common algorithm implementations and the practices to achieve a Best Concievable Runtime. 

Each algorithm is put in it's own class, so that each new itteration can be easily viewed in a single file.
All algorithms are run from the Program.cs file, and the terminals output is commented into the bottom of the functions as an example output.
